# Peerster - The Decentralized and Anonymous Chat

Implementation of a decentralized chat based on a gossip protocol to share messages and files along the peers of the system. Implementation was done in Go and Javascript for the graphical based user interface. Private messages were also added and routed using destination-sequenced distance vector routing protocol. As an extension, a layer of anonymous communication was added based on Torâ€™s design.
